<p> Their diet varies considerably. Their favorite foods are rodents and rabbits, but they will also eat birds, amphibians, and fruit. They prefer to hunt before the sunrise and during the late evening.They hunt by stalking their prey. They mark their territory by spraying their urine on trees. A Red Fox's body language consists of movements of the ears, tail, and postures. Foxes who are curious will rotate and flick their ears while sniffing. When a fox is playful, it will perk its ears and rise onto its hind legs. When afraid, they grin in submission, arch their backs, curve their bodies, crouch their legs, and lash their tails back and forth with their ears pointing backwards and pressed against their skull. The posture used to express submission is the the same thing, minus the back arching and crouching. Here are pictures of these behaviors. The first fox is hunting, the second one is scent marking, third one is curious, forth one is playful, and last one is submissive and afraid: </p>
